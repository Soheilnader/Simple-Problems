### Problem 1
how can we reach number 11 with list number of 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 and format of ○ * (○ - ○ / ○) + ○ ?

### Problem 2: Detect Pangram
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).
Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.
